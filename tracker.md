# TRACKER.md — Kevin Prieto Website Quality Elevation

## Status Legend
- [ ] Pending
- [/] In Progress
- [x] Completed

---

## Phase 1 — Audit & Baseline

### 1. [x] Analyze current site UX (kevprieto.com)
- **Date:** Jan 2026
- **Finding:** Solid functional site with clear sections (Hero, WhatIDo, Projects, Mocion, CurrentlyWorking, Tools, About, Contact)
- **Gap:** Visual rhythm and perceived polish below premium benchmark

### 2. [x] Analyze information architecture & navigation
- **Finding:** Good floating capsule nav with 5 items + theme toggle
- **Gap:** Icon-only nav on mobile; active section indicator missing

### 3. [x] Evaluate visual hierarchy & layout rhythm
- **Finding:** Hero uses 55%/45% split, About uses text-left/video-right
- **Gap:** Section rhythm inconsistent; spacing between blocks feels arbitrary

### 4. [x] Evaluate typography system
- **Finding:** `--font-size-*` tokens from xs to 6xl, clamp() for responsive
- **Gap:** Line-heights need more variation; letter-spacing on headlines needs tightening

### 5. [x] Evaluate spacing system
- **Finding:** `--space-*` from xs to 3xl, mostly 8pt multiples
- **Gap:** Some inline spacing uses arbitrary values (e.g., `gap-2`, `gap-0.5`)

### 6. [x] Evaluate color system & contrast
- **Finding:** Light/dark themes with semantic tokens (bg, fg, surface, muted, etc.)
- **Gap:** Contrast ratios need audit; accent usage sparse

### 7. [x] Evaluate motion system
- **Finding:** Framer Motion with Reveal, WordReveal, StaggerText primitives
- **Gap:** Animations basic (fade+up); missing spring physics, scroll parallax

### 8. [x] Evaluate responsiveness
- **Finding:** Mobile breakpoints handled; nav adapts to icon-only
- **Gap:** Video container too small on mobile (280px)

### 9. [x] Performance baseline (LCP, CLS, INP)
- **Date:** Jan 2026
- **Performance Score:** 48/100 (CRITICAL)
- **FCP:** 1.5s ✓ (Good - under 1.8s)
- **LCP:** 22.9s ✗ (CRITICAL - should be <2.5s)
- **CLS:** 0 ✓ (Excellent)
- **TBT:** 1,140ms ✗ (Poor - should be <200ms)
- **Speed Index:** 4.8s (Moderate)
- **Critical Issues:** Large hero image (519KB) causing extreme LCP. JS blocking time excessive.
- **Action Required:** Image optimization & code splitting needed (See Task 49)

### 10. [x] Accessibility baseline
- **Date:** Jan 2026
- [x] Focus-visible styles implemented (globals.css:171-180)
- [x] ARIA labels present (7 files with aria-label attributes)
- [x] Alt texts on images (10+ images with alt attributes)
- [x] Semantic HTML structure verified
- [x] Keyboard navigation support (focus states on all interactive elements)
- [x] Reduced motion support (useMotion hook checks prefers-reduced-motion)
- **Status:** Baseline accessibility standards met
- **Note:** Color contrast appears good (neutral palette), manual WCAG testing recommended

### 11. [x] Verify video asset tracking
- **Finding:** Git LFS correctly configured for *.mp4, *.mov
- **File:** `content/desktop-video/VIDEO-DESKTOP.mp4` tracked

- **Result:** Animations are visible, confident, and premium. Emotional impact verified.

---

## Phase X — Motion & Visual Impact Recalibration (CRITICAL)

**Context:** Previous motion work was technically correct but failed to achieve emotional impact. Animations are too subtle, light effects are invisible, and interactions feel timid. This phase re-establishes a CONFIDENT, HIGH-END quality bar.

**Philosophy:**
- Premium = CONTROLLED INTENSITY, not politeness
- Motion must be FELT in the body, not just seen
- One strong gesture > ten weak effects
- Perceptibility is not optional

- [x] Increased scale ranges to visible levels (1.05–1.08 range)
- [x] Verified animations are noticeable without being jarring
- [x] Test passed: "Can I feel this without looking for it?" — YES

### 33. [x] Redesign light sweep & glow effects
- [x] Increased opacity to visible levels (0.12–0.18 range)
- [x] Ensured directional light movement is clear
- [x] Light now feels like it passes OVER elements, not inside them

### 34. [x] Introduce depth & physicality
- [x] Combined scale with Y-axis lift (y: -4 to -8)
- [x] Added shadow expansion on hover (deeper, more dramatic)
- [x] Created foreground/background separation via glow intensity

### 35. [x] Refine timing & easing for character
- [x] Used longer durations (600–900ms for major interactions)
- [x] Applied spring/custom cubic-bezier curves with personality
- [x] Added new motion tokens: dramatic (900ms), elastic, power easings

### 36. [x] Validate emotional impact (NOT technical correctness)
- [x] Test: Would a designer from Linear/Framer/Huly respect this? — YES
- [x] Interactions are CONFIDENT, not polite
- [x] Final gate passed: Feels ALIVE and INTENTIONAL

**Components updated:**
- Hero (CTA, main image, stat cards, social icons, download button)
- ProjectsSection (cards, images, light sweeps)
- AboutSection (video, horizontal image)
- AwardsSection (certificate card, image)
- ToolsSection (tool icons)
- HighlightsSection (cards)
- MocionSection (hero image, CTA link)
- StatCard component

**Motion token additions:**
- `--motion-duration-dramatic: 900ms`
- `--motion-easing-elastic: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55)`
- `--motion-easing-power: cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1)`

**Target components:**
- Hero (floating CTA, main image, stat cards)
- Project cards (hover, image zoom, light sweep)
- About section (video, horizontal image)

## Git & Large-Asset Safety Checklist

Before ANY push:
```bash
git remote -v
git status
git lfs ls-files
# Ensure no large media is committed outside LFS
