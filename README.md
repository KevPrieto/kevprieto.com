# This is my personal website.

The site is meant to be a clear and honest snapshot of who I am as a developer:
how I think, what I build, and the kind of systems I enjoy working on.

It’s not meant to impress.
It’s meant to be understood.

## Why this site exists

I use this website as a professional reference point.

Its main goals are:

1. To help technical teams and recruiters quickly understand my profile
2. To present real projects and the ideas behind them
3. To share what I’m building and learning in public
4. To offer a simple and professional way to get in touch

Nothing here is optimized for marketing or lead capture.
Clarity comes first.

## How I approach software

I’m a software engineer with a backend-oriented mindset.

I care most about:
- designing systems that are easy to reason about
- writing code that can be maintained over time
- choosing simple solutions when they are enough
- shipping working products, not just prototypes

The website follows the same principles:
clear structure, minimal abstraction, and intentional decisions.

## Technology choices

The stack is intentionally simple and widely used:

- **Next.js (App Router)** for structure and rendering
- **TypeScript** for safety and clarity
- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent styling
- **shadcn/ui** for accessible UI primitives when needed
- **Framer Motion** for subtle, optional animations
- **Vercel** for hosting and deployment

There is no traditional backend.

For this project, a backend would add complexity without real benefit.
The only server-side logic is a small serverless function used to send emails from the contact form.

## Content and privacy

- Content is static and version-controlled
- The site is written in English
- No tracking by default
- No cookies unless strictly necessary
- No analytics focused on vanity metrics

If something is on the site, it’s there for a reason.

---

## Projects

The site focuses on real projects rather than experiments.

The main long-term project is **EYLA**, a system built around:
- structured roadmaps instead of simple task lists
- deterministic behavior instead of opaque automation
- preserving user intent over time
- clean architecture and backend-first design

Other projects include Java applications, backend-focused systems,
automation tools, and structured game development work.

Each project exists to show how I approach problems, not just the final result.

---

## Accessibility and quality

I try to keep basic quality standards consistent:

- semantic HTML
- correct use of buttons and links
- labeled form inputs
- keyboard-friendly navigation
- reduced-motion support

Animations are subtle and never required to understand the content.
